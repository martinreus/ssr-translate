# SsrTranslate

This project showcases the integration of Transloco I18N library, SSR (Server Side Rendering), Angular Material and Forms validation with said translation library.

Check out the tutorial explaining how everything was setup here -> [https://martinreus.github.io/angular-ssr-translations](https://martinreus.github.io/angular-ssr-translations/)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Build for serving with express (supports SSR)

Run `npm run build:ssr`

## Build and run with Server-side rendering enabled

Run `npm run build:ssr && npm run serve:ssr`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/`
